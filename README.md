# Mission Statement
Our team values the safety, cleanliness and integrity of our environment. We want to encourage fellow Seattleites to join our mission of keeping our city, and ultimately our world, clean.

# Problem Statement
Humans create tons of trash. Thatâ€™s no secret. It has practically become accepted in society that garbage can be found littered along the streets and buildings of any city. There is no urgency in the pressing consequences that littered trash is having on the environment. People simply pass the idea off as if it is not their problem. However, waste management is absolutely an issue that needs to be shared more with current day society. 

In a 2017 government study, it was found that Northwest Washington accumulated over 2.5 million pounds of litter and illegally dumped materials. Just in the King County area, almost 300 illegal dump sites were recorded. Our cities have been making efforts to help the environment, but the issues have still been pertinent to the cleanliness and health of our world. Our current waste management solutions are often not sufficient enough to make a lasting change in the trash that is littered all over the world. Although there may be individual sentiment to making an impact on this issue, the truth is that this needs to be a cultural change so that everyone and anyone can join in on fighting against the growing concern of waste management.
